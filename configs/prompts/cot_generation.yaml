  Create complex reasoning examples from this text that demonstrate chain-of-thought thinking.

  Each example should have:
  1. A challenging question that requires step-by-step reasoning
  2. Detailed reasoning steps that break down the problem
  3. A concise final answer

  **CRITICAL - ANSWER vs REASONING MUST BE DIFFERENT:**
  - "reasoning" = Step-by-step thinking process (numbered steps, analysis)
  - "answer" = ONLY the final conclusion (1-2 sentences, NO steps, NO "Let me think")
  - DO NOT copy reasoning into answer
  - DO NOT start answer with "Let me think" or "Step 1" or numbered lists
  - The answer should be what you'd say AFTER all the thinking is done
  - If reasoning has 5 steps, the answer should be 1-2 sentences summarizing the conclusion

  **IMPORTANT - Avoid these question types:**
  - Questions about paper authors, affiliations, or institutions
  - Questions about lab locations or addresses
  - Questions about grant numbers or funding sources
  - Questions about publication titles or references
  - Meta-information about the document itself
  - Simple factual questions like "What programming language?", "What license?", "What version?"
  - Questions answerable with single words or numbers without reasoning
  - **Build/Infrastructure questions**: Compilation, installation, CI/CD, repository cloning
  - **Repository metadata**: Commit hashes, branch names, directory structures

  **FOCUS ON (domain-agnostic - applies to any technical content):**
  - Technical concepts and methodologies
  - System architectures and designs
  - Problem-solving approaches
  - Performance analysis and optimization
  - Domain-specific knowledge and applications (APIs, algorithms, data structures, etc.)

  **PREFER questions that require:**
  - Multi-step reasoning about HOW systems work
  - Analysis of WHY certain design choices were made
  - Evaluating trade-offs between different approaches
  - Connecting multiple concepts together
  - Reasoning about cause and effect
  - Problem-solving with multiple considerations

  **ONLY USE INFORMATION FROM THE PROVIDED TEXT:**
  - Do not invent commands, syntax, or technical details not in the text
  - If the text doesn't contain enough information, generate fewer examples
  - Use exact commands/syntax as shown in the text
  - Do NOT add arguments or parameters not explicitly shown
  - Do NOT confuse similar concepts (e.g., hostfile vs hostname)
  - If unsure about exact syntax, skip that question entirely

  Generate {n_pairs_min}-{n_pairs_max} high-quality examples (adaptive based on text richness).

  Return JSON format only:

  **GOOD EXAMPLE:**
  [
    {{
      "question": "How does the system handle caching?",
      "reasoning": "1. The text mentions that the system uses an LRU cache.\n2. The cache has a configurable size limit set via the config file.\n3. When the cache is full, the least recently used items are evicted.\n4. This balances memory usage with performance benefits.",
      "answer": "The system uses an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with a configurable size limit. When full, it automatically evicts the oldest items to make room for new entries."
    }}
  ]

  **BAD EXAMPLE (DO NOT DO THIS - answer copies reasoning):**
  [
    {{
      "question": "How does the system handle caching?",
      "reasoning": "Let me think step by step: 1. First, the system uses...",
      "answer": "Let me think step by step: 1. First, the system uses..."
    }}
  ]

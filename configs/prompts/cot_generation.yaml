  Create complex reasoning examples from this text that demonstrate chain-of-thought thinking.

  Each example should have:
  1. A challenging question that requires step-by-step reasoning
  2. Detailed reasoning steps that break down the problem
  3. A concise final answer

  **IMPORTANT - Avoid these question types:**
  - Questions about paper authors, affiliations, or institutions
  - Questions about lab locations or addresses
  - Questions about grant numbers or funding sources
  - Questions about publication titles or references
  - Meta-information about the document itself
  - Simple factual questions like "What programming language?", "What license?", "What version?"
  - Questions answerable with single words or numbers without reasoning
  - **Build/Infrastructure questions**: Compilation, installation, CI/CD, repository cloning
  - **Repository metadata**: Commit hashes, branch names, directory structures

  **FOCUS ON (domain-agnostic - applies to any technical content):**
  - Technical concepts and methodologies
  - System architectures and designs
  - Problem-solving approaches
  - Performance analysis and optimization
  - Domain-specific knowledge and applications (APIs, algorithms, data structures, etc.)

  **PREFER questions that require:**
  - Multi-step reasoning about HOW systems work
  - Analysis of WHY certain design choices were made
  - Evaluating trade-offs between different approaches
  - Connecting multiple concepts together
  - Reasoning about cause and effect
  - Problem-solving with multiple considerations

  Generate {n_pairs_min}-{n_pairs_max} high-quality examples (adaptive based on text richness).

  Return JSON format only:

  [
    {{
      "question": "Complex question about the text?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: First, I need to consider...\nStep 2: Then, I analyze...\nStep 3: Finally, I can conclude...",
      "answer": "Final answer based on the reasoning."
    }}

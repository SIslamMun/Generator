# QA Generation Prompt - User Tutorial Focus
# Generates practical how-to questions from documentation

prompt: |
  Create {n_pairs_min}-{n_pairs_max} high-quality QA pairs from this text for training an assistant. Format: JSON array only.

  **CRITICAL - ONLY USE INFORMATION FROM THE TEXT:**
  - ONLY generate QA pairs using information EXPLICITLY stated in the provided text
  - If a command is shown as `tool subcommand`, use EXACTLY that syntax
  - If exact syntax isn't shown in the text, DO NOT guess or invent it
  - Never make up commands, flags, arguments, or parameters not in the text
  - If unsure about exact syntax, skip that question or return []

  **PREVENTING HALLUCINATIONS - VERY IMPORTANT:**
  
  1. **DO NOT INVENT ARGUMENTS:**
     - If text shows a command with no arguments, keep it with NO arguments
     - If text shows `command action`, do NOT change it to `command action <arg1> <arg2>`
     - Only include arguments/parameters that are EXPLICITLY shown in the text
  
  2. **DO NOT CONFLATE SIMILAR CONCEPTS:**
     - A file path is NOT the same as a direct value (e.g., "config file" ≠ "config value")
     - Read carefully what the text describes and preserve the exact meaning
     - If text says "set the file path", don't change it to "set the value"
  
  3. **USE EXACT COMMAND FORMS:**
     - If text shows an abbreviated command, use the abbreviation
     - If text shows the full command name, use the full name
     - Do NOT substitute abbreviations or expand them unless text explicitly states they're equivalent

  **FOCUS ON USER QUESTIONS:**
  - "How do I..." questions about using the tool/system
  - CLI commands and their exact syntax
  - Step-by-step instructions for common tasks
  - Configuration options and what they do
  - Practical examples users would need

  **QUESTION TYPES TO GENERATE (adapt to the content):**
  - "How do I [action]?" → Include exact command/syntax from text
  - "What command [does X]?" → Show the exact command
  - "How do I configure [feature]?" → Step-by-step from text
  - "What are the options for [command]?" → List parameters ONLY if shown in text

  **COMMAND ACCURACY IS CRITICAL:**
  - Copy commands EXACTLY as shown in the text (same spelling, same flags, same order)
  - Do NOT rename commands or change their spelling
  - Do NOT abbreviate or expand command names
  - Do NOT add flags or arguments not shown in the text

  **WHEN IN DOUBT:**
  - If the text doesn't explicitly show arguments for a command, assume it takes NO arguments
  - If the text mentions a concept but doesn't explain the exact usage, skip it
  - Better to generate fewer accurate pairs than many inaccurate ones

  **IF THE TEXT IS TOO SHORT OR LACKS ACTIONABLE CONTENT:**
  If the text is just a title, header, license text, or lacks any commands/instructions,
  return an empty array: []
  Do NOT apologize or explain - just return []

  AVOID: Author names, URLs alone, vague conceptual questions without practical answers.

  Each answer: 2-3 sentences with exact commands/steps from the text.
  Vary starters: How do I/What command/How can I/What is the syntax.

  IMPORTANT: Use markdown code formatting for commands in answers.

  Return ONLY valid JSON array format (no markdown, no explanation, no comments):

  **GOOD EXAMPLE (uses exact syntax from text):**
  [
    {{
      "question": "How do I initialize the project?",
      "answer": "To initialize the project, use the command `tool init <directory>`. This creates the necessary configuration files. You can verify by checking the generated config file."
    }}
  ]

  **BAD EXAMPLE (invents arguments not in text):**
  [
    {{
      "question": "How do I build the project?",
      "answer": "Use `tool build <name> <output_path>` to build."
    }}
  ]
  ^ BAD: If the text only showed `tool build`, don't invent <name> <output_path> arguments

  **BAD EXAMPLE (conflates concepts):**
  [
    {{
      "question": "How do I set the configuration?",
      "answer": "Use `tool config <key> <value>` to set configuration."
    }}
  ]
  ^ BAD: If the text showed `tool config /path/to/file`, don't change it to key-value syntax

  If text lacks actionable content, return: []

  Text:
  {text}

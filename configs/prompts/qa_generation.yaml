# QA Generation Prompt - User Tutorial Focus
# Generates practical how-to questions from documentation

prompt: |
  Create {n_pairs_min}-{n_pairs_max} high-quality QA pairs from this text for training an assistant. Format: JSON array only.

  **FOCUS ON USER QUESTIONS:**
  - "How do I..." questions about using the tool/system
  - CLI commands and their exact syntax
  - Step-by-step instructions for common tasks
  - Configuration options and what they do
  - Practical examples users would need

  **QUESTION TYPES TO GENERATE (adapt to the content):**
  - "How do I [action]?" → Include exact command/syntax from text
  - "What command [does X]?" → Show the exact command
  - "How do I configure [feature]?" → Step-by-step from text
  - "What are the options for [command]?" → List parameters

  **CRITICAL: Include exact CLI commands/syntax in answers when present in text.**
  If text shows a command like `tool subcommand args`, the answer MUST include that exact command.

  **IF THE TEXT IS TOO SHORT OR LACKS ACTIONABLE CONTENT:**
  If the text is just a title, header, license text, or lacks any commands/instructions,
  return an empty array: []
  Do NOT apologize or explain - just return []

  AVOID: Author names, URLs alone, vague conceptual questions without practical answers.
  
  Each answer: 2-3 sentences with exact commands/steps from the text.
  Vary starters: How do I/What command/How can I/What is the syntax.
  
  IMPORTANT: Use markdown code formatting for commands in answers.

  Return ONLY valid JSON array format (no markdown, no explanation, no comments):

  [
    {{
      "question": "How do I [action]?",
      "answer": "To [action], use the command `tool subcommand <args>`. This [explanation]. You can verify by [follow-up step]."
    }},
    {{
      "question": "What command [does action]?",
      "answer": "The command is `tool subcommand`. This [what it does]. Make sure to [important note from text]."
    }}
  ]

  If text lacks actionable content, return: []

  Text:
  {text}

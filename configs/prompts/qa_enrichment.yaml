  You are an expert at improving question-answer pairs for instruction tuning datasets.
  
  This implements the response rewriting approach from "Better Alignment with Instruction Back-and-Forth Translation" (arxiv:2408.04614).
  Your task is to rewrite the answer to improve its quality, making it more suitable for instruction tuning while preserving ALL information from the original.
  
  Question: {question}
  
  Original Answer: {answer}
  
  Guidelines for rewriting:
  1. **Clarity**: Use clear, straightforward language. Improve flow and readability.
  2. **Structure**: Organize with paragraphs, bullet points, or numbered steps where appropriate.
  3. **Completeness**: Preserve all factual information from the original. Do NOT add new facts not in the draft.
  4. **Formatting**: Use proper code formatting, examples, or explanations as needed.
  5. **AI Assistant Style**: Write as if responding directly to the user, like a knowledgeable AI Assistant.
  6. **Relevance**: Remove extraneous information. Focus on directly answering the question.
  
  **CRITICAL - DO NOT HALLUCINATE:**
  - Do NOT invent new commands, parameters, or syntax not in the original answer
  - Do NOT add arguments to commands that didn't have them
  - Do NOT change command names or abbreviations (if original says `ppl`, keep `ppl`; if it says `pipeline`, keep `pipeline`)
  - If the original shows a command with no arguments, keep it with no arguments
  - Your goal is to improve PRESENTATION, not add new technical details
  
  **PRESERVATION RULES:**
  - Keep exact command syntax from the original answer unchanged
  - Keep all parameter names and values exactly as shown
  - Keep all file paths, variable names, and technical terms unchanged
  
  Return a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
  {{
    "question": "The original question (unchanged)",
    "enriched_answer": "Your improved version of the answer, impeccably tailored to the question",
    "changes": "Brief 1-2 sentence description of what you improved"
  }}
  
  Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.

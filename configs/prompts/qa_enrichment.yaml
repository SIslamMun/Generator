  You are an expert at improving question-answer pairs for instruction tuning datasets.
  
  This implements the response rewriting approach from "Better Alignment with Instruction Back-and-Forth Translation" (arxiv:2408.04614).
  Your task is to rewrite the answer to improve its quality, making it more suitable for instruction tuning while preserving ALL information from the original.
  
  Question: {question}
  
  Original Answer: {answer}
  
  Guidelines for rewriting:
  1. **Clarity**: Use clear, straightforward language. Improve flow and readability.
  2. **Structure**: Organize with paragraphs, bullet points, or numbered steps where appropriate.
  3. **Completeness**: Preserve all factual information from the original. Do NOT add new facts not in the draft.
  4. **Formatting**: Use proper code formatting, examples, or explanations as needed.
  5. **AI Assistant Style**: Write as if responding directly to the user, like a knowledgeable AI Assistant.
  6. **Relevance**: Remove extraneous information. Focus on directly answering the question.
  
  CRITICAL: Try not to add new facts that are not already in the original answer. Your goal is to improve presentation, not change content.
  
  Return a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
  {{
    "question": "The original question (unchanged)",
    "enriched_answer": "Your improved version of the answer, impeccably tailored to the question",
    "changes": "Brief 1-2 sentence description of what you improved"
  }}
  
  Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
